I'm a passionate `software engineer`, `computer scientist` and `self-starter`. I'm happiest when I'm creating, learning and building new things from scratch. My current professional interests lie in truly understanding how full-stack engineering operates and how different moving parts coalesce together. On the side, I've been tinkering in different areas such as: competetive programming, algorithms textbooks, trying to understand programming languages and interpretors from under the hood, and develeping a basis on how computer graphics work. I hope to share my findings, writings, blogs, projects and repositories I find noteworthy here. 

I have a heavy background in computer science, having obtained my B.S. from `Rutgers University`. There I spent a lot of time studying and taking a mixed bag of electives on whatever area of computer science I found interesting. Some of my favorite classes were principles of programming languages, computer graphics, and intro to artificial intelligence. At Rutgers, I interned for a while in a research lab where the majority of my work was in image processing and automation which I found really interesting. Also, for a time I would help and tutor underclass students with things like data structures and algorithms and interview prep. 

Currently, I'm a `software engineer @ Capital One`. Feel free to reach out to me!
